# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this
repository.

## Project Overview

This is a financial transaction processing service built with Kotlin and Spring Boot. It transforms
financial transaction data into portfolio positions for valuation against market data. The project
consists of multiple interconnected services with circular dependencies that require careful build
management.

## Critical Build Information

### ⚠️ Circular Dependencies

This project has circular dependencies that **will cause clean builds to fail**. This is expected
behavior. Services depend on each other's contract stubs, creating a chicken-and-egg problem.

### Common Build Commands

```bash
# For daily development (recommended - fast build when stubs exist)
./gradlew buildSmart
./gradlew testSmart

# Clean build from scratch (Day 0 - use this order)
./gradlew :jar-common:build :jar-auth:build
./gradlew :svc-data:build
./gradlew :svc-data:pubStubs
./gradlew :svc-position:build
./gradlew :svc-position:pubStubs
./gradlew :svc-event:build
./gradlew :jar-client:build :jar-shell:build

# Or use the build script for clean builds
./build-with-stubs.sh

# Testing (ensures stubs are available)
./gradlew testWithStubs

# Code quality
./gradlew formatKotlin
./gradlew lintKotlin
./gradlew check
```

### Stub Management

Contract stubs are published to local Maven repository (`~/.m2/repository`):

- svc-data stubs: Required by jar-client, jar-shell, svc-position, svc-event
- svc-position stubs: Required by svc-event

```bash
# Publish stubs
./gradlew publishStubs

# Verify stubs exist
./gradlew verifyStubs
```

## Architecture

### Core Libraries (Build Order: 1st)

- **jar-common**: Shared utilities, models, and contracts
- **jar-auth**: Authentication and authorization
- **jar-client**: Client libraries for service communication (depends on svc-data stubs)
- **jar-shell**: Command-line interface (depends on svc-data stubs)

### Services (Build Order: 2nd)

- **svc-data**: Data persistence and market data services (publishes stubs)
- **svc-position**: Portfolio position calculations (depends on svc-data stubs, publishes stubs)
- **svc-event**: Corporate event processing (depends on both svc-data and svc-position stubs)
- **svc-agent**: AI agent service for chat functionality

### Contract Testing

Uses Spring Cloud Contract with hybrid approach:

- **Shared Context** (default): ~4-6x faster, shared Spring context
- **Isolated Context** (Kafka tests): Complete isolation, fixed ports 11999/12999
- Port allocation for shared context: jar-client(10990), jar-shell(10991), svc-event(10992),
  svc-position(10993)

## Deployment

**Production Environment**: `kauri.monowai.com`

- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes with Helm charts (`../bc-deploy/`)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL hosted on kauri.monowai.com
- **Configuration**: `../bc-deploy/env/minikube.yaml` contains service configurations
- **Secrets**: `../bc-deploy/.env` contains integration tokens (⚠️ use as variables, never expose)
- **Helm Charts**: Individual charts in `../bc-deploy/charts/` (bc-data, bc-position, bc-event,
  bc-view)

## CI/CD Pipeline (CircleCI)

The project uses CircleCI with optimized build pipelines:

- **build-and-test**: Complete build handling circular dependencies and stub publishing
- **Docker packaging**: Multi-platform images (linux/amd64, linux/arm64) published to GitHub
  Container Registry
- **Coverage reporting**: Codecov and Codacy integration
- **Branch filters**: Docker builds only on `master` and `/^mike\/.*/` branches
- **Container registry**: `ghcr.io/monowai/` (bc-shell, bc-data, bc-position, bc-event)

## Development Workflow

1. **Daily Development**: Use `./gradlew buildSmart` and `./gradlew testSmart` - these check for
   stubs first
2. **After Clean**: Use manual build order or `./build-with-stubs.sh`
3. **Before Committing**: Run `./gradlew check` for code quality
4. **Code Formatting**: Auto-format with `./gradlew formatKotlin`

## Authentication

Services require JWT token authentication via Auth0:

- **Environment Variable**: `BC_TOKEN` - JWT token for API access
- **Token Format**: Bearer token (automatically prefixed)
- **Common Issues**: 401/403 errors indicate expired token - refresh from Auth0
- **Token Usage**: Include in Authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer {token}`
- **Auth0 Setup**: See `svc-agent/AUTH0_SETUP.md` for configuration details

## OpenAPI Documentation

Services expose OpenAPI specifications via SpringDoc:

- **SpringDoc version**: 2.8.8 (configured in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`)
- **Configuration**: `springdoc.use-management-port: true` - OpenAPI docs served on management port
- **Access URLs**:
    - svc-data: http://localhost:9511/swagger-ui.html (management port)
    - svc-position: http://localhost:9501/swagger-ui.html (management port)
    - API docs available at `/v3/api-docs` endpoint
- **Authentication**: API endpoints require JWT token from `BC_TOKEN`

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Kotlin with Java 21
- **Framework**: Spring Boot 3.x
- **Build Tool**: Gradle 8.14+
- **Testing**: JUnit 5, Spring Cloud Contract, AssertJ
- **Code Quality**: Kotlinter (formatting), Detekt (static analysis)
- **API Documentation**: SpringDoc OpenAPI 3

# Test-Driven Development (TDD) Approach

## Mandatory TDD Workflow

When implementing new features or fixing bugs, ALWAYS follow this strict TDD cycle:

### 1. Understand Requirements First

- Clarify the feature/fix requirements before writing any code
- Ask questions if specifications are ambiguous
- Identify edge cases and expected behaviors

### 2. Write Tests FIRST (Red Phase)

- Write failing tests BEFORE implementing any functionality
- Tests should cover:
    - Happy path scenarios
    - Edge cases
    - Error conditions
    - Boundary values
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
- Start with the simplest test case

### 3. Run Tests to Confirm Failure

- Verify that new tests fail for the right reasons
- Ensure test failure messages are clear and informative

### 4. Implement Minimal Code (Green Phase)

- Write the SIMPLEST code that makes the tests pass
- Don't add functionality that isn't tested
- Focus on making tests green, not on perfect code

### 5. Run Tests to Confirm Success

- All new tests should pass
- All existing tests should still pass (no regressions)

### 6. Refactor (Refactor Phase)

- Improve code quality while keeping tests green
- Remove duplication
- Improve naming and structure
- Run tests after each refactoring step

### 7. Repeat the Cycle

- Continue with the next smallest piece of functionality

## Testing Framework Preferences

For Next.js/React projects, prefer:

- **Unit Tests**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Component Tests**: React Testing Library
- **Integration Tests**: Jest + MSW (Mock Service Worker)
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright or Cypress

## TDD Guidelines

### DO:

- Write tests that describe behavior, not implementation
- Keep tests focused and atomic (one assertion concept per test)
- Use meaningful test descriptions
- Mock external dependencies
- Test user-facing behavior over internal implementation
- Keep tests fast and independent

### DON'T:

- Write implementation code before tests
- Skip tests because "it's simple"
- Test implementation details
- Write tests that depend on other tests
- Leave failing tests uncommitted
- Mock everything (only mock boundaries)

## Test Coverage Expectations

- Aim for 80%+ code coverage
- 100% coverage for critical business logic
- Focus on meaningful coverage, not just hitting percentages

When Working on Existing Code
If adding to untested code:

Write tests for the NEW functionality first
Add tests for AFFECTED existing code
Refactor with tests in place
Gradually improve test coverage

Checklist Before Committing

All tests are passing
New functionality has corresponding tests
Tests are clear and well-named
No commented-out test code
Test coverage hasn't decreased
Tests run quickly
Linting checks pass

Remember
"Red, Green, Refactor" - This is the rhythm of TDD. Never skip the Red phase!
