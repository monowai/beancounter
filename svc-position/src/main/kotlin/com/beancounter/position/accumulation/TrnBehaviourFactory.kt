/**
 * A factory class that manages the instantiation and retrieval of transaction accumulation strategies.
 * Each transaction type is associated with a specific strategy that encapsulates the logic for processing
 * and accumulating transactions into financial positions.
 *
 * This class dynamically handles the association between transaction types and their corresponding behaviors,
 * allowing for flexible insertion of new behaviors without modifying the client code. It supports a range of
 * transaction types, including buys, sells, deposits, withdrawals, and more, each managed by a specialized
 * behavior class.
 *
 * @throws BusinessException if an unsupported transaction type is requested.
