# BeanCounter Auth Module

Services are secured using OAuth2 and the exchange of JWT tokens.

The purpose of this module is to make it easy to include a jar, wire up a bit of configuration and then get on with
building your service

This guide is focused on how to make the security mechanism work and how to test it.

I wanted to be able to:

* Use `MockMvc` to test my Auth mechanism
* Have a simple configuration mechanism that enabled security to "just work"
* Provide support for both SCOPE and ROLE as returned by KeyCloak

## Key Classes

The easiest way to see how things work is to check out the `AuthTest` class which injects a simple secured controller
and then uses the various classes, via MockMvc, to verify security

`SecurityConfig` Enable/Disable security _in your service_ - run with `nosecurity` to disable AUTH mechanisms

`ResourceServerConfig`  the ResourceServer that negotiates and converts tokens with the JWT endpoint (KeyCloak)

`JwtRoleConverter` Used by `ResourceServerConfig` to convert KC realm claims to Spring roles

`TokenService` Handy dandy means of extracting the `AuthenticationToken` from the `SecurityContext`

`TokenUtils` Utility class that returns JWT tokens that can be used for testing purposes

`AuthorityRoleConverter` Used by `MockMvc` to extract realm claims from the JWT

### Configuring your service

```$groovy
implementation(
        project(":jar-auth"),
        "org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-security",
        "org.springframework.security:spring-security-oauth2-resource-server",
        "org.springframework.security:spring-security-oauth2-jose",
```

Add the following config to your file, changing URI and realm as appropriate

```$yaml

keycloak:
  uri: "http://keycloak:9620"
  realm: "bc-dev"

spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      resourceserver:
        jwt:
          jwk-set-uri: "${auth.uri}/auth/realms/${auth.realm}/protocol/openid-connect/certs"

```

## Scope and Roles

This is an example of how roles and scopes are returned in a JWT token

```json
"realm_access": {
    "roles": [
      "offline_access",
      "uma_authorization",
      "user"
    ]
  },
"scope": "beancounter profile email roles"
```

In BC, the entire API is secured using a scope as you can see in `ResourceServerConfig`

```java
    http.cors().and()
        .authorizeRequests()
        // Scope permits access to the API - basically, "caller is authorised"
        .mvcMatchers(authPattern).hasAuthority("beancounter")
        .anyRequest().permitAll()
        .and()
        .oauth2ResourceServer()
        .jwt()
        // User roles are carried in the claims realm_access and are used for fine grained control
        //  this converter is not used when using Mock testing but is used when running with a full configuration
        .jwtAuthenticationConverter(jwtRoleConverter);
```

A scope of `beancounter` basically means "authorized"; You have to be authorized to call the API.

In KeyCloak, it is generally more efficient assign roles to groups and then put users into groups.

By default `spring-security-test` supports OAuth `scope`. You can't call `hasRole` to check a scope or `hasScope` to
check a role. While there
is [no difference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19525380/difference-between-role-and-grantedauthority-in-spring-security)
between a `SCOPE_` and a `ROLE_` except for the prefix, there is if you use the wrong annotation. You can see this by
setting a breakpoint on `SecurityExpressionRoot.hasAnyAuthorityName`

`JwtRoleConverter` is responsible for merging scope and roles into a `GrantedAuthority` set allowing us to check by ROLE
or SCOPE.

A controller can be simply secured with the `@PreAuthorize` annotation, or `@Secured` if you prefer

```java
  @RestController
  static class SimpleController {
    ...
    @GetMapping("/hello")
    @PreAuthorize("hasRole('user')")
    String sayHello() {
      return "hello";
    }

    @GetMapping("/what")
    @PreAuthorize("hasRole('no-one')")
    String sayWhat() {
      return "no one can call this";
    }
}
```

To unit test the above controller, you're going to do something like this:

```java
```java
@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class)
// This configuration is required as the jar-auth is not a SpringBoot application
@ContextConfiguration(classes = {
    MockServletContext.class,
    TokenService.class,
    NimbusJwtDecoder.class,
    DefaultJWTProcessor.class,
    ResourceServerConfig.class})
@ImportAutoConfiguration({
    WebMvcAutoConfiguration.class})
@WebAppConfiguration
public class AuthTest {

  @Autowired
  private WebApplicationContext context;

  @Autowired
  private TokenService tokenService;

  private MockMvc mockMvc;

  // Needed because mock testing will not call the configured JwtRoleConverter
  private final AuthorityRoleConverter roleConverter = new AuthorityRoleConverter();

  @BeforeEach
  void setup() {
    mockMvc = MockMvcBuilders
        .webAppContextSetup(context)
        // Enable the magic
        .apply(springSecurity())
        .build();
  }

  @Test
  public void has_AuthorityToSayHelloButNotToSayWhat() throws Exception {
    // Simple class that contains a userId 
    SystemUser user = SystemUser.builder()
        .build();

    Jwt token = TokenHelper.getUserToken(user);

    mockMvc.perform(
        get("/hello")
            .with(jwt(token).authorities(roleConverter))
            .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    ).andExpect(status().isOk())
        .andReturn();
    mockMvc.perform(
        get("/what")
            .with(jwt(token).authorities(roleConverter))
            .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    ).andExpect(status().isForbidden())
        .andReturn();

  }
}
```  

All of the above code can be seen in the `AuthTest` class

## KcConfig

To test tokens in a service, you need to have KeyCloak running.

Start by getting KeyCloak started and configured. KC config work is discussed in [bc-demo](../bc-demo/README.md) and is
beyond the scope of this guide. Thanks to the magic of Docker and the way KC is packaged, most of the config work has
been done for you, allowing you to focus on the internals of securing your app.

You can start KC, in a configured to work with development defaults from the `bc-demo` folder with the following command

```shell script
cd ../bc-demo
docker-compose start postgres keycloak
```
