# Test Improvements Summary for svc-event

This document summarizes the test improvements applied to the `svc-event` service module, following the standards established in `jar-common`, `jar-auth`, and `svc-position`.

## Improvements Applied

### 1. Test Naming Conventions
- **Created**: `TEST_NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md`
- **Purpose**: Documents standardized naming conventions and best practices for `svc-event` tests
- **Content**: Test class naming, method naming patterns, KDoc documentation standards, Given-When-Then structure, assertion guidelines, and mocking practices

### 2. Test Helpers
- **Created**: `src/test/kotlin/com/beancounter/event/utils/TestHelpers.kt`
- **Purpose**: Provides reusable test utilities to reduce code duplication and improve consistency
- **Features**:
  - Test data creation helpers (`createTestPortfolio`, `createTestAsset`, `createTestPosition`, etc.)
  - Common assertion patterns (`assertPortfolioProperties`, `assertAssetProperties`, etc.)
  - Standardized test constants
  - Event and corporate event creation utilities
  - Trusted transaction event and query creation helpers

### 3. New Test Coverage

#### EventServiceTest.kt
- **Created**: Unit tests for EventService
- **Coverage**:
  - Corporate event processing and saving
  - Event retrieval by ID and asset
  - Event scheduling and range queries
  - Integration with position service and event publisher
  - Error handling for missing events
- **Features**:
  - Mockito-based unit tests
  - Comprehensive service testing
  - Error condition testing

#### EventLoaderTest.kt
- **Created**: Unit tests for EventLoader (partial coverage)
- **Coverage**:
  - Event loading for portfolios and specific dates
  - Integration with portfolio and price services
  - Authentication context handling
- **Features**:
  - Mockito-based unit tests
  - Portfolio service integration testing
- **Note**: Some tests were simplified due to complex authentication dependencies

## Test Standards Applied

### Naming Conventions
- Test methods follow `should {expected behavior} when {condition}` pattern
- Test classes follow `{ClassName}Test` pattern
- Descriptive and clear test names

### Documentation
- Comprehensive KDoc for all test classes
- Method-level documentation explaining test purpose
- Clear description of what each test verifies

### Structure
- Given-When-Then pattern for all tests
- Clear separation of setup, action, and verification
- Consistent test organization

### Assertions
- AssertJ assertions throughout
- Descriptive assertion methods
- Consistent `assertThat()` usage

### Test Data Management
- Centralized test constants in TestHelpers
- Reusable test data creation methods
- Consistent test data patterns

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved Readability**: Clear test names and structure make tests easier to understand
2. **Better Maintenance**: Consistent patterns reduce the effort needed to update tests
3. **Enhanced Collaboration**: Standardized approach helps team members work together
4. **Reduced Duplication**: Shared test helpers eliminate code duplication
5. **Higher Quality**: Comprehensive documentation and structure lead to better test coverage
6. **Increased Coverage**: New tests for previously untested components

## Migration Guidelines

When updating remaining tests in svc-event:

1. Rename test methods to follow the new convention
2. Add comprehensive KDoc documentation
3. Implement Given-When-Then structure
4. Use AssertJ assertions consistently
5. Extract common test data to TestHelpers
6. Ensure all tests follow the established patterns

## Files Modified

### New Files
- `TEST_NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md`
- `TEST_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md`
- `src/test/kotlin/com/beancounter/event/utils/TestHelpers.kt`
- `src/test/kotlin/com/beancounter/event/service/EventServiceTest.kt`
- `src/test/kotlin/com/beancounter/event/service/EventLoaderTest.kt`

## Challenges Encountered

### Authentication Complexity
- The EventLoader service has complex authentication dependencies that make unit testing challenging
- LoginService requires AuthConfig in constructor, making mocking complex
- Some tests were simplified to focus on testable public interfaces

### Recommendations
- Consider refactoring EventLoader to make authentication dependencies more testable
- Use integration tests for complex authentication flows
- Focus unit tests on business logic rather than infrastructure concerns

## Next Steps

The test improvements for `svc-event` are largely complete, with some limitations due to authentication complexity. The established patterns and standards can be applied to any remaining test files in the service.

## Coverage Summary

- **EventService**: Comprehensive unit test coverage
- **EventLoader**: Basic unit test coverage (limited by authentication complexity)
- **Test Helpers**: Complete utility coverage for common test scenarios
- **Standards**: Fully implemented across all new tests
